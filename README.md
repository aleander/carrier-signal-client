# Carrier Signal Lost - Client

This is a client for [Carrier Signal Lost][1], just a toy for fooling around
with TypeScript and websockets - and if I ever get to that, canvas stuff.

## How to run

Make sure you have Carrier Signal Lost running on localhost. Then, run
`npm run serve` and go to `https://localhost:8080/`.
